Objects Oriented paradigm -OOPs
c - procedural programing
c++ - object oriented

Class and Object

Java doesn't provide multiple inheritance but that can we done through interfaces

1.Inheritance ---> to inherit properties from parent
Class A { // parent class
// properties
}
Class B {
properties from A

child
}
// inheritance is for code reuse-ability

2.Polymorphism --->

poly - many
morphins - forms

1. Thing have mutiple forms
method overriding // method overloading


3.Encapsulation
// wrapping up of data in single unit

wrap a data in capsule form?

ex - car while we know how to drive but we don't care how engine works and shifting of gears
ex - getter/setter

4.Abstraction

Hiding the details
and showing the actual functionality

ex- car

Abstract classes
it showing whatever relevant to you
interfaces
